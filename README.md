Our system leverages Apache Pyspark and big data analytics to process a vast dataset of recipes and extract pertinent features like ingredients, dietary labels, and recipe ratings. Subsequently, we utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and construct a model that predicts the recipes most likely to appeal to a user based on their ingredient list and dietary preferences.
